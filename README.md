# Comparative-Advantage

Imagine a theoretical situation where two countries that produce two of the same products decide to trade these products with eachother. Quantitative studies have historically shown that for an individual country, specializing in the production of a select number of goods, then trading some of those goods for desired goods produced by another country that also specializes gives both countries the optimal quantity of combined goods, provided that the trade deal benefits both countries. This concept is known as specialization, and is commonly studied amongst students taking an introductory Micro or Macroeconomics course. The point of analyzing this type of problem is to identify which countries should specialize in which good given the maximum amount of each good one country can produce, and comparing it with the maximum amount of each good the other country can produce. The specific good a country specializes in is known as its "Comparative Advantage", and is chosen based on the opportunity cost of solely producing one good and comparing opportunity costs across both countries.  

Many students initially struggle understanding this concept. Practice worksheets for this topic are also hard to find or hidden behind a paywall, let alone the answer keys. This tool serves to give both students the ability to practice this concept as many times as they need to until they nail the concept perfectly. It draws inspiration from the custom calculators provided for introductory physics in the HyperPhysics website to practice fundamental physical problems from common topics such as 2D motion/Trajectory. One example of such a calculator can be found here: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/traj.html#tra5

# Instructions 

1. Go to https://www.tablesgenerator.com/text_tables, click the "Table Column", hover over "Set Size", and adjust the size to a 3x3 table 

2. On cells B1 and C1, enter in the two goods the countries will exchange with eachother

3. On cells A2 and A3, enter in the names of the two countries that will be trading with eachother

4. On cells B2 and C2, enter in the maximum quantities of goods the country entered in A2 can produce 

5. On cells B3 and C3, enter in the maximum quantities of goods the country entered in A3 can produce

6. Click the "generate" button below, copy the table structure, create a new text file, and paste the table into the text file

7. Remove the left and top corners of the top left cell of the table while keeping the next two cells in the first row in the same position. Take a look at the shape of the table contained in "sample.txt" for a visualization of how this should look. When done, save your text file, remember the name of your text file, and save it in the same directory as the program files you downloaded. 

8. Now, simply run the ComparativeAdvantage.java source file through your preferred method(IDE or command line) and provide the appropriate input when prompted. When the program has finished running, go back into the directory and view the text file. Given the numerical constraints you set, the file represents the best possible combination and trade deal possible with a mathematical explanation of why that is the case.
